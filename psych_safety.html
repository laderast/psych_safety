# What is Psychological Safety?

What is psychological safety? Kahn defines it as:
.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Psychological safety is being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career.
] 

Number 1 predictor of a team's success, and student success

# Stereotype Threat

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
Reminding people of negative stereotypes, even in subtle ways, can make them anxious about the risk of confirming those stereotypes, in turn reducing their performance.

# Roleplaying Exercise (3 minutes)

Think about a class where you were reluctant to ask a question. 

- What was it about the situation that made you reluctant?
- Did you feel valued in that situation?
- Were there any previous statements or behavior from faculty or other students that made you reluctant?

# What steps can you take?

- Code of Conduct

---
# Establish a Class Code of Conduct

A **code of conduct** defines what is *expected/acceptable* and *unacceptable behavior* in the classroom in order to make the class a psychologically safe space for learning. 

- Defines values
- Defines unacceptable behavior
- Defines consequences

---
# Not meant to replace OHSU's code of conduct

- Meant to supplement the OHSU Code of Conduct

# Define Values

# Establish Consequences/Communications Channel

- Needs an Anonymous Reporting Channel - perhaps a form
- Different levels of violations
    - Ask student to leave session
- Actions should focus on safety of reporters

# Have an External Contact

- Useful if students are reluctant to contact you
- Should be someone who can talk to you about difficult issues

---
# Build on Previous Work

You don't have to start from scratch! There are code of conducts that you can build on.

# Having a Code of Conduct makes an inclusive space

- Sets the tone for your course
- Establishes your course as a safe space
- Enforce consequences, emphasize safety of reporters
