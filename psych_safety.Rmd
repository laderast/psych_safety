.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[

# Roleplaying Exercise (3 minutes)

Think about a class where you were reluctant to ask a question. 

- What was it about the situation that made you reluctant?
- Did you feel valued in that situation?
- Were there any previous statements or behavior from faculty or other students that made you reluctant?

# Establish a Class Code of Conduct

A **code of conduct** defines what is *expected/acceptable* and *unacceptable behavior* in the classroom in order to make the class a psychologically safe space for learning. 

- Defines values
- Defines unacceptable behavior
- Defines consequences
